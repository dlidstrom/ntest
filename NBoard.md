# Introduction #

Here is an example position that shows what I am trying to achieve. We can see that there are 6 moves (E1, B3, G3, H3, B5, G5) that lead to draws, one move (H6) that leads to loss by two, and a deviation (H4) that is bad enough to not warrant expansion (yet).

All interesting lines have been expanded fully and to get ntest out of book you need to choose a move with score as bad as -4.37.
